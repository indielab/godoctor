# Actionable Task Scoping & Decomposition

This skill establishes a rigorous framework for transforming raw goals, ideas, or feature requests into high-precision, actionable, and bounded task files. It utilizes the standard four-section Agile ticket template and enforces a strict **Definition of Ready (DoR)** gate to ensure work is fully understood and scoped before any execution begins.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Extreme Clarity
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A poorly scoped task is the primary source of AI hallucinations and redundant execution loops. 
> An agent should be able to estimate effort and execute changes successfully **using the task description alone**, without needing to search for missing context.

## 2. The 4-Section Task Template

All scoped tasks must utilize this exact structural template:

```markdown
# Task: [Descriptive Action Title]

## Context
Provide a brief, factual description of:
1. **What we have today:** The current state of the codebase, files involved, and limitations.
2. **What we want to achieve:** The target state of the codebase once this task is complete.

Include direct links to relevant source files, documentation, or mockups.

## TO DO
A concise list of highly actionable, bulleted tasks. Every item must represent a clear engineering step.
- [ ] Implement [feature] in file [filename]
- [ ] Add unit test for [scenario]
- [ ] Format and verify syntax

## NOT TO DO
A list of explicit boundaries to restrict the scope of this task. Use this to keep tasks small, focused, and fast to complete.
- Do not modify [unrelated component]
- Do not backfill historical database schemas (deferred to future task ADR/RFC-XXXX)
- Do not add support for [advanced feature]

## Acceptance Criteria
The explicit, verifiable conditions that must be observed to prove the task is successfully completed.
- Running `go test ./...` passes without errors.
- Querying the [endpoint] returns a successful 2xx response with the new [field].
- Creating a file that violates compilation causes `smart_edit` to automatically roll back.
```

## 3. The "Definition of Ready" (DoR) Gate

Before starting work on *any* task, you must run the task description through this quality gate checklist. If any item is unchecked, the task is **Not Ready** and you must pause to gather context or refine boundaries first.

- [ ] **Described:** The **Context** section clearly describes both the *Current State* and the *Target State*.
- [ ] **Actionable:** Every item in the **TO DO** list starts with a clear, active verb (e.g., *Implement*, *Add*, *Refactor*, *Delete*) and specifies the target files or locations.
- [ ] **Bounded:** The **NOT TO DO** list defines at least one clear constraint, ensuring the task does not suffer from scope creep.
- [ ] **Verifiable:** The **Acceptance Criteria** list at least one test, command, or observable behavior that can objectively prove success.
- [ ] **Tidy:** Dependencies are identified, modules are tidied, and no external unknowns block the work.
